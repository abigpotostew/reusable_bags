## Reusable Bags
Hi! This is the first mini-game in an educational game series I'm working on designed to be both enjoyable and educational for kids ages 10-15 or so.

The educational part of the game will teach environmental and sustainable living concepts, or in other words 'green' ideas. This will include ideas such as:
* Pollution - Cars, trash, chemicals, and how we can reduce our pollution.
* Water conservation - taking shorter showers, Earth's fresh water reserves, 
* Plastic - Plastic pollution. Using glass and metal over plastic. Reducing single use items.
* Renewable energy - solar is good, but affordable and easy to make solar panels are better.
* Greenhouse Gases.
Within the game, players will have access to a large amount of information regarding each topic. After each level, or evern while pausing the game, players can tap into this knowledge base to learn about any of these concepts more deeply.

The actual game is set up mini-game style such that each game is played quickly and can be replayed easily. Players can also play through all of the games to get a full experience.
